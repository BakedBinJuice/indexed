## Type
Minter is a stand alone global rewards and loyalty points network That uses DPoS (Delegated Proof Of Stake). (https://www.minter.network/).

## Tx Cost
transaction cost's are generally less than 1 BIP - 0.05 USD. This is because it can process so many transactions a second therefore the network doesn't require a high fee. (https://www.minter.network/).

## Finality
Minter is based on Tendermint Consensus Engine, which has instant finality property. It means what once block is committed by ⅔ validators of network it cannot be reverted. As a result – there is no need to wait more than 1 confirmation of incoming transaction. (https://www.minter.network/docs/integrate).

## Consensus
Minter uses the DPoS algorithm that provides high reliability. This allows validators and delegators for profit from their own contribution to the network. (https://www.bitdeal.net/minter-network).

## $ Efficient
Minters utilises it's Delegated Proof of Stake algorithm to handle staking. For example you can start staking at 1000 BIP - 1.92 USD, and earn a reward of 33.736 BIP - 0.06 USD, or 404.8315 BIP - 0.77 USD. (https://www.stakingrewards.com/earn/minter).

## Max TPS
Minter's powerfull blockchain can handle 10,000 transactions per second. (https://www.bitdeal.net/minter-network).
